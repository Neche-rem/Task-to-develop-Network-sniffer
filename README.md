## Network Sniffer

This project is a network sniffer built using Python and the Scapy library. It captures, analyzes, and logs network traffic, offering insights into the flow of data within a network.


Before using this project, ensure that you have the following:

1. **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. **Scapy** installed. You can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

### Features

- **Packet Capture**: Captures packets using the `sniff()` function with optional filtering.
- **Packet Analysis**: Extracts and prints detailed information about each packet, including source IP, destination IP, protocol, and payload.
- **PCAP File Saving**: Saves the captured packets to a PCAP file for later analysis.
- **Customizable**: Allows the user to specify the number of packets to capture and whether to save them.

 Payload Format
By default, the payload is generated in binary format. If the payload contains binary or non-text data, converting it to text might not make sense, and it's often best to leave it in its raw byte-string format for accuracy.

If you need to generate the payload in a human-readable form, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
if packet.haslayer(IP):
    ip_src = packet[IP].src
    ip_dst = packet[IP].dst
    proto = packet[IP].proto
    payload = str(packet[IP].payload)
```

### Usage

To run the network sniffer, simply execute the script. You can specify the interface, packet filter, and other options as needed.

This README provides clear instructions, explains the features, and includes a copyable code block that demonstrates how to modify the script for different needs.
