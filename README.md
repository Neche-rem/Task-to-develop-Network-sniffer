This project is a network sniffer built using Python and the scapy library. It captures, analyzes, and logs network traffic, offering insights into the flow of data within a network.
It captures packets using the sniff() function with optional filtering.
It extracts and prints detailed information about each packet, including source IP, destination IP, protocol, and payload.
It can save the captured packets to a PCAP file for later analysis.
The script allows the user to specify the number of packets to capture and whether to save them.
